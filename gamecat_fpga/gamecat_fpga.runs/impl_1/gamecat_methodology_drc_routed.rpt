2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell override_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) override_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell override_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) override_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
