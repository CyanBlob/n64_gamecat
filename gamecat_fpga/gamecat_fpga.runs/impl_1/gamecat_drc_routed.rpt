2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net address_active_reg[15]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin address_active_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell address_active_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net override1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin address_full_reg[31]_i_1/O, cell address_full_reg[31]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net override7_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin override_reg_i_3/O, cell override_reg_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net override_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin override_reg/L3_2/O, cell override_reg/L3_2 (in override_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net read_state_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin read_state_reg_i_2/O, cell read_state_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net step_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin step_reg_i_2/O, cell step_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
